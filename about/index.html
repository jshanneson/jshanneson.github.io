                Hello Everyone!<br /><br />
                I'm Joshua and I am passionate about so many things... <br />I love creative writing, music and have tons of other hobbies. Over the years I have learned to yoyo, juggle, use flowersticks, contact juggle, lockpick, write poetry, create 3D animations, create video games, and use CAD to create useful 3D designs. I am also an avid jazz musician and am classically trained on trumpet and piano, as well as knowledgeable about guitar playing, song writing and singing. Having been a Scout from the age of 5 to 17 I have a passion for the outdoors and love camping in all seasons with friends and family.
